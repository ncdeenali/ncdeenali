# Hi, I'm Nadeen <3
- 🎓 I'm a 3rd (almost 4th ^^) Year AI & Data Science Student  
- 📊 I'm super passionate about Data Analysis, Machine & Deep Learning, and Pattern Recognition
- _And_ I love working with Databases & backend logic, understanding what goes on behind the blackbox functions.

Right now I'm exploring GenAI, LLMs, and real world AI apps using LangChain, FastAPI, and more!

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages:** _Mainly_ Python and SQL with some knowledge in Java
- **AI Tools:** LangChain, Ollama, Hugging Face, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch 
- **Focus Areas:** GenAI, CNNs, Arabic NLP, RAG, Prompt Engineering, Statistical Model Evaluation, EDA

## 🚀 Recent Projects
- **AmeenChat** (Ongoing) – LLM based banking assistant using LangChain + Ollama + RAG 
- **Steganalysis Classifier** (Ongoing) – Deep learning model using EfficientNet on JPEG stego data
- **Arabic Medical NLP Classifier** (June 2025) – Cleaned real Arabic queries and explored word embeddings, reaching 98% on SVC and fine tuned AraBERT to 98%

## Hope you find my work useful ^^
